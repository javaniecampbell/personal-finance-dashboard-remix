This flow creates a comprehensive personal finance management system where users can:

3. Set and monitor budgets
4. Transfer money between accounts
5. View their overall financial health
6. Analyze their spending patterns and budget performance

The application now provides a holistic view of a user's finances while allowing detailed management of individual accounts and transactions. It combines high-level overviews with the ability to drill down into specific details as needed.

Assumption the Prisma schema already includes the Account model and the necessary relationships. Given this, let's focus on the remaining implementation steps:

1. Modify API endpoints and services:

   a. Create new endpoints for account management:

   - GET /api/accounts - List all accounts for the user
   - POST /api/accounts - Create a new account
   - PUT /api/accounts/:id - Update an account
   - DELETE /api/accounts/:id - Delete an account
   - GET /api/accounts/:id/transactions - Get transactions for a specific account

   b. Update existing transaction endpoints:

   - Modify POST /api/transactions to include accountId
   - Update GET /api/transactions to allow filtering by account

   c. Create a new service for account operations:

2. Update the UI to include account management and display account information:

   a. Create new components for account management:

   - AccountList
   - AccountForm (for creating and editing accounts)
   - AccountDetails (to show transactions and balance for a specific account)

   b. Update the Dashboard component to display account balances:

3. Update the transaction creation process:

   - Modify the transaction form to include account selection
   - Update the transaction creation logic to handle transfers between accounts

4. Adjust budget calculations:

   - Update the budget performance calculations to consider only expenses from relevant accounts
   - Add income tracking separately from budget performance

5. Add data validation and error handling:

   - Implement proper validation for account creation and updates
   - Add error handling for account-related operations

6. Update existing components:
   - Modify the TransactionList component to show associated account information
   - Update the BudgetOverview component to reflect the new account-based structure

By implementing these changes, we'll integrate the account system into your existing application, providing a more comprehensive financial management experience for your users. Remember to test thoroughly as you implement these features, especially around transaction handling and balance calculations.
